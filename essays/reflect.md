## Software Engineering
This year I have started taking my first steps into the world of software engineering. I have learned much about the fundamental concepts of software engineering, some I didn't even know about. 

## Coding Standard
Coding on my own, I often overlooked the importance of coding standards, instead focusing more on whether or not the code actually worked. After all, using single or double quotes for strings doesn't change whether the code works, and going back and changing all the double quotes to single quotes does seem like a waste of time. However, this is simply a result of learning something new. After overcoming the initial hurdle, writing your code according to the standard will become second nature. Of course, you may wonder why even bother? Well the answer to that would be to improve the understandability of your code. Sure you may understand it now, but give it a couple years and you may just be scracthing your head, wondering what it is your looking at. This is even worse when you want your code to be understandable to other people, whether it be open sourced or your working in a group. In a way, it is similar to grammar. Sure you can write an entire paper like Yoda with all your sentences like "wrote the code, he did" and be understandable, but reading an entire paper in that style would probably give anyone a headache. Both of these improve the readability of what your writing, which is undoubtedly useful when you want people to read your work. 

## Project Management
When we started in groups for our software engineering class, we were heavily encouraged to use Issue Driven Project Management. For this specific management style, our group met up twice a week to discuss issues and divide our next three or four days of tasks to do. Each task was documented as a Github issue and placed on a Project Board. Each person performed work on their issue in its own branch, merging them to the master branch every one or two weeks. This was a simple, yet efficient way to manage the project. It ensured that everyone had work to do, didn't interfere with one another, and documented all the major work performed on the project. 

## Work Ethics
The topic of ethics in computer science have become more prevalent lately, especially as it came to light how much information giant tech companies have on people.
