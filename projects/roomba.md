summary: Developed a moving object with obstacle detecting capabilities.
---

In this project, I had to create a border and obstacles using a provided map in the form of an array. The code will generate a roomba that will move randomly and on contact with an object, it will either to collect it if it is a dirt or move in a different direction if it is an obstacle.

I was the sole programmer for this project.

In this project, I learned how to connect an array to an image, and in doing so, create the map for the code from the array. I also learned how to detect obstacles with a moving object and have the object chose to move in a different direction.
