## Software Engineering
This year I have started taking my first steps into the world of software engineering. I have learned much about the fundamental concepts of software engineering, some I didn't even know about. 

## Coding Standard
Coding on my own, I often overlooked the importance of coding standards, instead focusing more on whether or not the code actually worked. After all, using single or double quotes for strings doesn't change whether the code works, and going back and changing all the double quotes to single quotes does seem like a waste of time. However, this is simply a result of learning something new. After overcoming the initial hurdle, writing your code according to the standard will become second nature. Of course, you may wonder why even bother? Well the answer to that would be to improve the understandability of your code. Sure you may understand it now, but give it a couple years and you may just be scracthing your head, wondering what it is your looking at. This is even worse when you want your code to be understandable to other people, whether it be open sourced or your working in a group. In a way, it is similar to grammar. Sure you can write an entire paper like Yoda with all your sentences like "wrote the code, he did" and be understandable, but reading an entire paper in that style would probably give anyone a headache.
