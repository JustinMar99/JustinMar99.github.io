summary: Developed a paint spraying software for ICS 111.
---

This was the first computer science project assigned to us in the class. The background is an image of a wall, the spray paint can had to be able to switch between two colors, with the can changing to indicate the selected color. The two colors I picked were red and green. On holding the left mouse button, the can would spray the appropriate color as a small circle in a semi-random area where the mouse is with the appropriate sound effect.

For this project, I was the sole programmer responsible for it.

I learned about how to add sound effects, synch up sound effects to various actions and how to edit sound files to allow the code to continuously replay the sound effect. I had to add a silent sound effect and play it, so that the other sound effects for the spray can didn't play. I also learned about how to track the mouse position and continuously update the spray can image to follow the mouse. I also learned about how to place images in the z axis, by using pushToBack() and pullToFront() methods to place the background and spray can appropriately, allowing the spray can to cover the mouse cursor.

A video demonstration of the code is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSu5INOgcMo.
