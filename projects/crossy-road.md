In this project, I worked with a partner to create our own version of the crossy road game. The code generates a chicken that the player controls with the wasd keys. The goal is get the highest score by reaching the top part of the screen, if the truck hits the player, then it is game over. The code randomly selects a premade map to generate grass, roads, and obstacles for the player. 

For this project, I worked on the chicken, its movement, sound, and collision with other objects, and on the map generation. 

I learned about how to create an array and more implications you can do to generate a map from it.
