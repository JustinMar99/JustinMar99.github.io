## Why software engineering
Coming in to university, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I initially decided on being a pharmacist because my dad told me that it was a good job with good pay and I figured, why not. However, trying things out and exploring different possibilities in college has started to shift my thinking. Now, I no longer want to just have a well-paying job that will set me up for the future, but to do something that I enjoy. I took an intro to coding class and did robotics in high school, thus I already had an interest in computer science, however I saw it more as a hobby until my cousin, who graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science, told me about software engineering which caused me to reconsider my major. 

Seeing how much technology has impacted our lives and how much we currently rely on it, I think that software engineering will be a vital need in the modern society that will only continue to grow. I would like to work on software that can help people in their daily lives and make things easier for them. 



## Skills and experience to develop
I hope that I can improve my abilities to critically think on problems and come up with efficient solutions to solve them. I also hope to expand my language skills, thus allowing me to use the most optimal function of each language to solve a problem. I would also like to develop my ability to solve a problem in multiple different ways, that way if I am needed to make a program in a certain way, I would be able to do so.
