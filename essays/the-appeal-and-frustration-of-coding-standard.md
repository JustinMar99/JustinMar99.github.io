## Coding Standards 
Ah, coding standards, something that I have changed my mind on repeatedly over the years. Sometimes I am glad for a standard to make viewing code easier. When being presented code without it, the messy formatting makes it feel like I'm bashing my head against a wall. On the other hand, after I finished writing code and my errors are a bunch of mundane things such as spaces, indent, using a different symbol when the one I use can also work, it can be a very frustrating experience. The pros of coding standards are certainly there, it formats things in a nice and understandable way for other people or maybe yourself if you take a long hiatus from your code. However, there are certainly some cons to it, having to change the way you code to a specific way to accomplish the same job.  

# Pros 
The pros of coding standards are many and I believe that ultimately, they are good and should be implemented. Big coding projects are not the work of a single person and over the years, more and more people work on it. To make it easier, it is good to have a coding standard to make it appear more tidy and thus easier to read. Otherwise new people will have to carefully read through it to understand what it does and which parts are parts of a section.  

# Cons 
The cons of coding standard are well like all standards, beginning to use them will be difficult. It may not be the way you are used to doing things, thus before you adjust to writing that way, you will have to go back and edit parts of your code to match the coding standard. You will also have to constantly search up what the error is to understand why it is being flagged in order to fix your code. Furthermore, the implementation of the coding standard can make things more difficult, especially ones that prevent the code from running for all errors. Sometimes you want to write a quick code and run it but you get an error because you forgot to put a space somewhere or maybe you used double quotations instead of single quotations.  

# Conclusion 
Many of the problems I have with coding standards are many frustrating experiences that comes with having to use a new one and getting errors that I may or may not understand when I try to run it. However, they are ultimately a good thing that all programmers should use to make sure that information is presentable and easy to read for other people and yourself.
