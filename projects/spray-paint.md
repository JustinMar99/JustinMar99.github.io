summary: Developed a paint spraying software for ICS 111.
---

This was the first computer science project assigned to us in the class. The background is just an image of a wall, the spray paint can had to be able to switch between two colors, with the can changing to indicate the colors, the two I picked were red and green. On holding the left mouse button, the can would spray the appropriate color as small circles in a random area where the mouse is with the appropriate sound effect.

For this project, I was the sole programmer responsible for it.

I learned about how to synch up sound effects to various actions and how to edit sound files to allow the code to continuously replay the sound effect without being too jarring. I also learned about how to track the mouse position and continuously update the spray can image to follow the mouse.

A video demonstration of the code is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSu5INOgcMo.
