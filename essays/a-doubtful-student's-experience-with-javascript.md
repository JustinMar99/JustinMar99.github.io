## My experience with Javascript
My first experience with Javascript was when my parents told me to disable javascript in my browser for safety reasons. This negatively affected my perception of 
Javascript. I saw it as not being that good of a language that was still being used for some reason. However, working with Javascript has started to change my 
perception on the language. I can see why some people do like the language as it allows for more options over the previous languages that I have learned, c, c++, and Java. An example being the lack of restriction of data types for arrays. I have worked on code where I got an error, only to realize that I was trying to add a different data type to an array or trying to use multiple different types. I definetely prefer to have the option to do this than not. However, I feel that it is too early for me to say if this is a "good" or "bad" language as I haven't seen the full extent Javascript has to offer and currently don't understand how I can use all the things we learned in ES6 in my own code. I feel that as I furhter progress and experiment on these different applications of Javascript, I will begin to better understand the pros and cons of the language. 

# The WODs and how they help my Javascript skills
The practice WODs were useful since my only other usage of Javascript was through the assigned FreeCodeCamp work, and while I learned a lot about Javascript from it, it didn't replicate actually using Javascript to make something from the ground up. I believe WODs are a great way to ease our usage of Javascript. The current WODs are simple tasks, similar to ones we have done in previous classes. With my current experience, it is a matter of acutally writing it out in Javascript and the WODs definetely provide that. However, the current WODs means that I haven't felt the need to use any of the features that Javascript has, like arrow syntax, so hopefully future WODs provide the oppurtunity to use them, and allow us to grow in our flexibility and approach when it comes to using Javascript.
